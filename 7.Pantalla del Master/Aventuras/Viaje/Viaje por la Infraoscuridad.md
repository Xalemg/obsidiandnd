# Random Encounters

Each day of travel through the Underdark, check twice to see if the characters encounter anything unusual: once while they are traveling, and again while they are camped or resting. Roll a d20 and consult the Random Encounters table to determine what, if anything, they encounter. Characters might encounter special terrain, one or more creatures, or a combination of the two.

Any random encounter that occurs while the party is camped is automatically a creature encounter, in which case determine the encounter by rolling a d20 and consulting the Creature Encounter table.

The Underdark contains dangerous hazards and wondrous terrain. Special terrain rules are explained after the table.

## Boneyard

The characters come upon an eerie cavern littered with countless bones of various creatures. Whether the site is a natural graveyard for some Underdark species or the former lair of a fearsome predator, the characters can potentially gather useful material for crafting among the bones.

When the party enters a boneyard, roll a d20 and consult the table to determine what creatures, if any, are present. The undead rise up out of the bones and attack when the first characters are halfway across the cavern.

## Boneyard Encounter
The characters come upon an eerie cavern littered with countless bones of various creatures. Whether the site is a natural graveyard for some Underdark species or the former lair of a fearsome predator, the characters can potentially gather useful material for crafting among the bones.

When the party enters a boneyard, roll a d20 and consult the table to determine what creatures, if any, are present. The undead rise up out of the bones and attack when the first characters are halfway across the cavern.
## Cliff and Ladder
A cliff 2d4 × 10 feet high blocks the party's passage, but a rolled-up rope ladder is visible at the top. If someone can climb the cliff—requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check—and toss down the ladder, the characters can proceed. Otherwise, they lose a day's travel finding another route. 

## Crystal Clusters
The adventurers pass through a _faerzress_-suffused area containing fist-sized chunks of quartz that shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. A sharp blow to one of the crystals, including throwing it so it impacts a hard surface, causes it to burst in a 10-foot-radius flash of blinding light. Any creature within the radius must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb) by this effect repeats the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb).

## Fungus Cavern
The adventurers stumble upon a cavern filled with fungi and mushrooms of all sizes and types. See "[Fungi of the Underdark](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#oota,1,fungi%20of%20the%20underdark,0)" and choose some interesting examples.

## Gas Leakp
The adventurers come upon a cavern with a dangerous natural gas leak. Any member of the party with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher detects signs of the gas. The characters' travel pace for the day is slowed by half as they circumvent the area, but there are no ill effects. If the gas goes undetected, each character in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any open flames brought into the area cause the gas to explode. Each creature in the explosion must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Gorge

The characters must make a difficult climb down a gorge 2d4 × 100 feet deep and up the other side, or find a way around it. Their travel pace for the day is slowed by half unless they come up with a plan to cross the gorge quickly.

## High Ledge
The characters must walk along an 18-inch-wide ledge that skirts a ravine 2d6 × 10 feet deep. The party's travel pace for the day is slowed by half, and each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid a fall. Precautions such as roping everyone together let each character make the save with advantage. Increase the pursuit level of the drow by 1.

## Horrid Sounds
For hours, the party's travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering echoing through nearby passages, without any apparent origin. Each character must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character's madness level increases by 1.

## Lava Swell
As the party traverses a long and winding corridor, a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure behind them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the lava swell, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save. Decrease the drow pursuit level by 1.

## Muck Pit
The adventurers must wade through a broad, 3-foot-deep pit of slimy muck. The muck is [difficult terrain](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,3,difficult%20terrain) and characters have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws while within it, but their travel pace for the day is slowed by half if they go around it.

## Rockfall
As the adventurers make their way through a long, twisting cavern, a tremor sets off a rockfall. Each party member must attempt three DC 12 Dexterity saving throws, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on each failed save. Any [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb) creature not moved out of the area is buried under rubble, taking an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its turns until the creature is dug out or dead. Decrease the drow pursuit level by 1.

## Rope Bridge
A ravine 2d4 × 10 feet wide and 2d4 × 10 feet deep cuts across the party's path, spanned by an old rope bridge. If the characters cut the bridge after they pass, the drow pursuit level decreases by 1.

## Ruins
The adventurers come across a small ruin hidden in the Underdark. This might be the creation of a subterranean race or a surface ruin that collapsed and sank long ago. If the characters search the ruins, there is a 50 percent chance of them finding 1d4 trinkets (see chapter 5, "[Equipment](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,trinkets,0)," of the _Player's Handbook_). Roll on the Trinkets table or choose appropriate ones.

## Shelter
The party stumbles upon a cave that is sheltered and easily defended. If the characters camp here, they can finish a long rest without any chance of an encounter while they are resting.

## Sinkholep
One random party member steps on and collapses a sinkhole, and must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling into a 20-foot-deep pit and taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. Climbing out of the pit requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

## Slime or Mold
As the adventurers pass through a small cavern, they encounter a patch of slime or mold. Roll a d6 and consult the table to determine what type of slime or mold is present (see "[Dungeon Hazards](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,dungeon%20hazards,0)" in chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ for details on these threats).

| d6  | Encounter            |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1-3 | Patch of green slime |
| 4-5 | Patch of yellow mold |
| 6   | Patch of brown mold  |

## Steam Vent

A hot steam vent erupts beneath a random party member, who must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.

## Underground Streamp27

A waterway 2d4 × 5 feet wide cuts across the party's path. The stream is shallow and easily crossed, and the characters can drink and refresh their water supplies. Edible fish inhabit the stream, so that the DC of any foraging attempts for food in this area is reduced to 10. Crossing the stream reduces the drow pursuit level by 1.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/OotA/011-02-04.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/OotA/011-02-04.webp)
## Warning Sign
The characters enter a cavern dotted with stalagmites and stalactites. Those with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher spot the sigil to the right carved into one of the stalagmites.

The sigil is a drow warning sign that means "Demons ahead!" Any non-drow creature that touches the symbol must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's madness level increases by 1.

If the characters take a long rest within one mile of the warning sign, roll a d20 and consult the table to determine what, if anything, they encounter at the end of their rest.

## Warning Sign Encounter

## Webs

Sticky webs fills a passage (see "[Dungeon Hazards](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,dungeon%20hazards,0)" in chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_). The webs extend for hundreds of feet. Unless the characters come up with a plan for clearing the webs quickly, the party's travel pace for the day is halved as the characters are forced to cut their way through or find an alternate route.

Check for an encounter when the party enters the webs. On a roll of 1–2 on a d6, the characters encounter 1d4 [giant spiders](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20spider_mm) lurking among the webs.

# Creature Encounters
Keep the party's level in mind when fleshing out these encounters, and allow the characters to retreat from or avoid an encounter that is too great a challenge. Escape should come at a cost, however. Characters fleeing their camp to avoid a creature encounter might be forced to abandon food and water supplies, for example.

## Ambushers
One or more creatures attempt to ambush the party as it makes its way through the Underdark. Roll a d20 and consult the table to determine what the characters encounter.
If the ambush occurs in the monster's lair, there is a chance that characters searching the area find something of interest or value. Roll a d20 and consult the table below to see what, if anything, they find.

## Ambusher Lair Discoveries


## Carrion Crawler
The characters encounter a [carrion crawler](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#carrion%20crawler_mm) scouring tunnels and caves for food.

There is a 25 percent chance that the crawler is domesticated and outfitted with a leather saddle and harness, though there's no sign of the rider. A character can approach and mount the carrion crawler without being attacked by succeeding on a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. While in the saddle and harness, a rider can remain mounted on the carrion crawler as it crawls across walls and ceilings.

## Escaped Slaves
## Fungi
Roll a d6 and consult the table to determine what kinds of fungi the characters encounter.



There's a 25 percent chance that a gas spore carries a memory fragment from a dead beholder in its spores (see the gas spore's description in the "Fungi" entry of _Monster Manual_). This memory can be of anything you wish, or you can roll a d4 and consult the Beholder Memories table.

## Beholder Memories
dal animal companion

## Giant Fire Beetlesp
The characters encounter 3d6 [giant fire beetles](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20fire%20beetle_mm) scouring tunnels and caves for food. Characters in need of light sources can harvest the glowing glands of slain beetles.

## Giant "Rocktopus"
This creature is a [giant octopus](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20octopus_mm) that has evolved to live and thrive on land. It can alter its coloration to appear as a rock formation, and it tends to lurk in crevices and fissures, attacking smaller creatures that wander near. It has a walking speed of 20 feet and a climbing speed of 10 feet, loses its Hold Breath feature, and replaces its Underwater Camouflage feature with the following feature:

Camouflage. 

The octopus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

## Mad Creature
The party encounters a creature driven insane by the influence of the demon lords. Roll a d4 and consult the table to determine what appears. Then roll on the [Indefinite Madness](https://5e.tools/tables.html#indefinite%20madness_dmg) table in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ to determine the nature of the creature's madness. If cured of its madness, the creature behaves in accordance with its alignment.


There is a chance that the mad creature has something of interest or value in its possession. Roll a d20 and consult the table below to see what, if anything, it has. The creature doesn't part with the item willingly.

## Mad Creature Possessions

## Ochre Jelly

As the characters move through a series of caves, they attract the attention of a [ochre jelly](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ochre%20jelly_mm). The ooze follows the characters, attacking when they stop to take their next rest. Characters in the back rank of the marching order who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher spot the ooze following them.

## Raiders
This group of raiders from the surface ventured into the Underdark looking for riches and got lost. Roll a d6 and consult the table to determine what appears. The raiders are initially hostile toward the party, though clever characters might try bribing them for safe passage or information.


There is a chance that the leader of the group has something of interest or value. Roll a d20 and consult the table below to see what, if anything, the leader of the raiders has in its possession.

## Raider Leader Possessions

## Scouts

The [drow scout](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#drow%20scout_oota) is searching for escaped slaves. If he spots the party, he'll attempt to avoid notice and take away information regarding the group's location (see "[Drow Pursuit](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#oota,1,drow%20pursuit,0)").

The myconid scouts are indifferent toward the party and unwilling to discuss their mission or their travels with the adventurers.

Shield dwarf scouts are friendly if the party includes one or more surface dwellers. They are willing to give the party a day or two's worth of food and water rations.

## Society of Brilliance
Every member of the Society of Brilliance has an alignment of neutral, an Intelligence of 18 (+4), and fluency in multiple languages including Dwarvish, Elvish, and Undercommon (although [Grazilaxx](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#grazilaxx_oota) prefers to communicate using telepathy). Its statistics are unchanged otherwise. Members are erudite and talkative, preferring diplomacy and debate over violence (though they defend themselves if attacked).

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/OotA/012-02-01.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/OotA/012-02-01.webp)

Each society member can cast the [teleport](https://5e.tools/spells.html#teleport_phb) spell once per day, but the intended destination must be within 30 feet of another society member. This teleport effect can be disrupted (see "[Faerzress](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#oota,1,faerzress,0)" earlier in the chapter), which is how society members sometimes end up in far corners of the Underdark, separated from their fellows.

Members of the Society of Brilliance are aware that paths to the surface world exist but haven't explored any of them (their concerns are with the Underdark, after all). If the characters seem intent on reaching the surface, a society member might suggest they look for a guide in one of the Underdark's larger settlements, such as Blingdenstone or Gracklstugh. The society member can provide detailed verbal directions that characters can follow to reach whichever Underdark settlement they desire. However, the society member can't guarantee that the route is safe. If characters are searching for something else, the society member provides whatever assistance it can.

## Spore Servants

One or more creatures killed and reanimated by Zuggtmoy's spores observe the characters as they pass by. The spore servants don't communicate and don't attack except in self-defense. Roll a d10 and consult the table to determine what the characters encounter.

## Traders

These traders ply the tunnels of the Underdark, traveling from settlement to settlement. Roll a d4 and consult the table to determine what appears.


Deep gnome and drow traders have a 50 percent chance of having half their number in [giant lizards](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20lizard_mm) as mounts and pack animals. Duergar traders have a 50 percent chance of having half their number in [male steeders](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#male%20steeder_mtf) (see [appendix C](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#OotA,19)) as pack animals. If there are male steeders present, there is a 50 percent chance that the traders are escorted by a [duergar kavalrachni](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#duergar%20kavalrachni_mtf) astride a [female steeder](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#female%20steeder_mtf) (see [appendix C](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#OotA,19) for both).

The traders carry goods worth 5d4 × 10 gp plus ten days of provisions per member of their party; they are willing to sell up to 20 percent of either. If drow traders see the adventurers and have the opportunity to report it, increase the drow pursuit level by 1.
